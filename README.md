This Python calculator program allows the user to perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The user selects an operation, enters two numbers, and the program calculates and displays the result. It also handles division by zero with an error message. ![calculator](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a5d74ee9-4909-40aa-b5bd-5ec2fe2aa6ad)
